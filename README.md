# Online Doctor's Appointment using PHP


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

In this project I have created a web project where a person can book a doctor's appointment online.

## Method

- Clone or download the repository to any port you have apache (or any php), example- localhost:80 
- import the sql table from the SQL DATABASE EXPORT folder in the datalayer folder to localhost/phpmyadmin
- in your browser tab run 
```sh
http://localhost/DoctorAppointment/applicationlayer/index.php
``` 
- The application is running!
